				<p> Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

				<br />
				<p>
				After more than 9 years of working on WordPress CMS. Currently, I would like to grab a new opportunity and challenge myself with other field such as Laravel framework so
				I am applying for the position of Senior PHP Web Developer.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>

				Although I donâ€™t have a rich experience with the Laravel framework, I am full of spirit and take a progressive attitude. I'm not afraid to change and ready to learn every day. I believe I will quickly get familiar with Laravel and become proficient in using this framework.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Hope to have the opportunity to prove myself as well as bring value to your company.
			</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> Thank you for your consideration.</p>
				Sincerely,<br />
				Dan Nguyen
