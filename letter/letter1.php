		After more than 9 years of working on WordPress CMS, currently, I would like to grab a new opportunity and challenge myself with other field such as Laravel framework .

		Although I donâ€™t have a rich experience with the Laravel framework, I am full of spirit and take a sympathetic attitude. I'm not afraid to change and ready to learn every day. I believe I will quickly get familiar with Laravel and become proficient in using this framework.

		Hope to have the opportunity to prove myself as well as bring value to your company.

		Thank and best regards,
